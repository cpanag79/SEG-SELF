# Cell Segmentation - SEG-SELF Method 

Matlab Code: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/67313-cell-segmentation-seg-self-method 

Region based method for segmenting and splitting images of cells in an unsupervised manner.

We present a region based method for segmenting and splitting
images of cells in an automatic and unsupervised manner [1-2]. The proposed
method is able to automatically detect and split touching cells.
We will appreciate if you cite our papers [1, 2] in your work:

The newer method RFOVE for cell segmentation can be found in https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74200-rfove
